        Home: Aria Farm
      </p>

      <p>On a road-facing paddock stood a burned-out shack. The TB Shack, whose truth is mired in story. All the inhabitants died, or, each person to dwell there became afflicted with a curious disease that doctors couldn&#8217;t diagnose, and just labeled tuberculosis.</p>

      <p>It was torched by a ghost or my uncle, who walks like a ghost now: twenty-seven kilograms lighter than he was and somewhere in Australia. He wakes to the sound of cockatoos, which have fled to the paddock facing his modern housing project. His box is purple. He chose the colour. He tore a hernia into himself as he reached to paint the eves.</p>

      <p>Before the farm was sold, my uncle asked me to clean the machinery in his father&#8217;s workshop. On the windowsill, amid the grime, sat a placard: Arndt and Sons Engineering. No son entered the family business. The lathe was layered with years of grime; beneath it was an avocado green inset with a granite-like shimmer, like stones beneath the Mokauiti River.</p>

      <p>In my brother&#8217;s room there were envelopes. Drawers and drawers of envelopes organized by size: sandy brown as the back of my hand and the smallest filled with seeds and mottled beans. In the wardrobe my grandmother stored the plastic bags she hand washed and hung in rows on the line, then stuffed into each other to be stored. As if there might come a time when we would need all of them, suddenly, at once.</p>

      <p>I suppose if there had been a great flood, or an approaching gust that could tear all our being from the earth, there would have been some fabric to hold onto.</p>

      <p>There was something I liked to do. Some tactile pleasure in unsheathing a feather from a follicle with a fingernail.</p>

      <p>My grandmother plucked chickens until her hands were shitty. She pulled the heads from baby sparrows roosting in the eves of the coops. She told me it was quick and painless. She was right.</p>

      <p>I never told her that I let the motherless little chooks sit on my shoulders and once, one pecked at my eye. When I look into light I am missing a pixel. Maybe I always have been. Maybe that Rhode Island Red took it from me. I only felt bad that I gave him the chance to do wrong by me, by being careless.</p>

      <p>She doesn&#8217;t remember, but when I was young, my grandmother taught me how to candle eggs. We walked to the coop when it was dark and shifted a chicken slightly, the bulk of her from side to side, and put her warm eggs gently in a bucket. The dark lay like a sheet. The Milky Way shattered above us. I placed an egg atop a toilet roll, tucked in so it wouldn&#8217;t fall, and shone a torch through the dark tunnel. Sometimes we would see the form of a small life as a shadow within, and sometimes we wouldn&#8217;t.</p>

      <p>My grandfather went blind before he knew he couldn&#8217;t see. So well acquainted was he with the streets of Newmarket that he could step off the curb and wave to the shopkeepers within the mist of his cataracts. It was only when his fingers stopped being able to read the warnings etched into the machines of his workshop; only when he realized that the light was filtered before it reached him, that he went to a doctor, who stared into his darkness and pronounced it complete.</p>

      <p>I ran into an old neighbour who still lives next door to our Aria Farm. She told me I shouldn&#8217;t go back. &ldquo;It&#8217;s not the same,&rdquo; she said, but she wouldn&#8217;t tell me why. Only that I shouldn&#8217;t return. My brother once promised me that he would buy it back for me, one day. I can&#8217;t let go of the hope that he will. I could hope to buy it for myself but I&#8217;m a poet in this economy. He&#8217;s a physicist: his approach to the stars is more practical. He&#8217;ll use an Internet start-up to make ours align.</p>
