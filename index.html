          Home: Aria Farm
        </p>

        <p>On a road-facing paddock stood a burned-out shack. The TB Shack, whose truth is mired in story. All the inhabitants died, or, each person to dwell there became afflicted with a curious disease that doctors couldn&#8217;t diagnose, and just labeled tuberculosis.</p>

        <p>It was torched by a ghost or my uncle, who walks like a ghost now: twenty-seven kilograms lighter than he was and somewhere in Australia. He wakes to the sound of cockatoos, which have fled to the paddock facing his modern housing project. His box is purple. He chose the colour. He tore a hernia into himself as he reached to paint the eves.</p>

        <p>Before the farm was sold, my uncle asked me to clean the machinery in his father&#8217;s workshop. On the windowsill, amid the grime, sat a placard: Arndt and Sons Engineering. No son entered the family business. The lathe was layered with years of grime; beneath it was an avocado green inset with a granite-like shimmer, like stones beneath the Mokauiti River.</p>

        <p>In my brother&#8217;s room there were envelopes. Drawers and drawers of envelopes organized by size: sandy brown as the back of my hand and the smallest filled with seeds and mottled beans. In the wardrobe my grandmother stored the plastic bags she hand washed and hung in rows on the line, then stuffed into each other to be stored. As if there might come a time when we would need all of them, suddenly, at once.</p>

        <p>I suppose if there had been a great flood, or an approaching gust that could tear all our being from the earth, there would have been some fabric to hold onto.</p>

        <p>There was something I liked to do. Some tactile pleasure in unsheathing a feather from a follicle with a fingernail.</p>

        <p>My grandmother plucked chickens until her hands were shitty. She pulled the heads from baby sparrows roosting in the eves of the coops. She told me it was quick and painless. She was right.</p>

        <p>I never told her that I let the motherless little chooks sit on my shoulders and once, one pecked at my eye. When I look into light I am missing a pixel. Maybe I always have been. Maybe that Rhode Island Red took it from me. I only felt bad that I gave him the chance to do wrong by me, by being careless.</p>

        <p>She doesn&#8217;t remember, but when I was young, my grandmother taught me how to candle eggs. We walked to the coop when it was dark and shifted a chicken slightly, the bulk of her from side to side, and put her warm eggs gently in a bucket. The dark lay like a sheet. The Milky Way shattered above us. I placed an egg atop a toilet roll, tucked in so it wouldn&#8217;t fall, and shone a torch through the dark tunnel. Sometimes we would see the form of a small life as a shadow within, and sometimes we wouldn&#8217;t.</p>

        <p>My grandfather went blind before he knew he couldn&#8217;t see. So well acquainted was he with the streets of Newmarket that he could step off the curb and wave to the shopkeepers within the mist of his cataracts. It was only when his fingers stopped being able to read the warnings etched into the machines of his workshop; only when he realized that the light was filtered before it reached him, that he went to a doctor, who stared into his darkness and pronounced it complete.</p>

        <p>I ran into an old neighbour who still lives next door to our Aria Farm. She told me I shouldn&#8217;t go back. &ldquo;It&#8217;s not the same,&rdquo; she said, but she wouldn&#8217;t tell me why. Only that I shouldn&#8217;t return. My brother once promised me that he would buy it back for me, one day. I can&#8217;t let go of the hope that he will. I could hope to buy it for myself but I&#8217;m a poet in this economy. He&#8217;s a physicist: his approach to the stars is more practical. He&#8217;ll use an Internet start-up to make ours <a href="#warburton" data-opens="warburton">align.</a></p>

        <p>I am interested in the parts of houses that no one visits. Front gardens, the places between trees, the corner behind the woodpile.</p>

        <p>Wolfie&#8217;s mother used to smoke a single cigarette each night on the back step, believing that no one knew. From our window we could see the smoke and the trees Wolfie had never climbed. They were ill positioned.</p>

        <p>I liked that she sat out in the Australian night, smoking a single cigarette, at least looking at the places we were blind to.</p>

        <p>If I could go back I think I would touch everything within that house. Then I would circle the perimeter. I would eat a pie and mushy peas for dinner and I would laugh around the table. I would scatter bread for the birds and I would kiss my boyfriend goodnight, and tell him that his house and his family were the best memory I&#8217;ve ever chosen to forget.</p>

        <p>I hope his mother is okay. She was very sick. If she dies, I have already missed her. I would feel grief I have no ownership of.</p>

        <p>On a hill above their house was a convent. We spend Christmas Eve there one year, at mass, and together the siblings and I giggled under our breath. I don&#8217;t know what we were laughing at, only that I felt very young. That the ceiling was high and the people were blank-faced and kind, and that I believed in the story of baby Jesus, though never the <a href="#empire-rd" data-opens="empire-rd" data-closes="warburton">man.</a></p>

        <p>The new owner&#8217;s daughter went to my high school. We were in the same math class. She told me that they hosted a seventies-themed housewarming party, and people asked them how they decorated so well. &ldquo;We laughed,&rdquo; she said, and I felt like she was laughing at me. We were never able to afford to change the linoleum or the brightly geometric wallpaper. And I had liked my house, for all its flaws. &rdquo;I didn&rsquo;t like what happened there, but it was home for a long, long time.</p>

        <p>They knocked it down and build a stucco mansion. Years later I went to their open home, when the girls had moved out and the parents were ready to move on. I didn&#8217;t recognize the yard at all. I knew my house was gone, but I had been hoping for some kind of recognition with the perimeter. Some visual confirmation of the narrative I had been building into my memory in unripe chunks: rotting grapefruit and hard little gooseberries. Rabbit hutches and tents without floors. A vast garage with a box of kittens in the corner. A compost pile of rusting Christmas trees.</p>

        <p>But, there was a swimming pool and complete fencing. The space I had contained a whole childhood in looked very small. I understand that dimensions change: a room is always much smaller without furniture. But I was angry with my aunt, who thought it would be fun to ‘have a nosey.&#8217; I was angry that my memory could be wrenched so completely.</p>

        <p>I dreamed for six days about walking through the old house and opening cupboards, looking for my mother. We had a double-door laundry cupboard stuffed full of paper and craft supplies, and a hot water cupboard where Mum would put my pajamas before slipping me into them. A couch obscured the living-room cupboard containing my dad&#8217;s old record player, which he played when he was happy. My room had two slender wardrobes: one for every day and the other for dress-ups and dolly clothes.</p>

        <p>It was by no means an underprivileged childhood.</p>

        <p>Our parents fought. The police called more often than one would hope. Our spa pool brimmed with slugs.</p>

        <p>I suppose the dreams implied that I left some part of my mother there. I once told her that I thought maybe all of the bad things my father said about her were true. She was making her bed, as she always did on a Sunday, and I watched her collapse onto the pile of sheets in tears. I left the house, to go to some Christmas show that I wanted her to come to. I left her there crying.</p>

        <p>My mother and I used to fight until one of us laughed. It&#8217;s hard to remember someone when they have been gone for six years, but I when I think of fights I see her arms crossed and a smirk beginning to curl at the edge of her mouth. Her attempt at serious. My attempt at betrayed. We always said we were sorry, but I never apologized for the time I hurt her most. My mother. Who cooked too much and ate vegemite by the spoonful, and everything else from her index finger. My mother who wanted to die at <a href="#wolfie" data-opens="wolfie" data-closes="empire-rd">home.</a></p>

        <p>He&#8217;s in Auckland and I practice what I will say: &ldquo;I will always love you more than a little bit, but a little less since you chose to love her. How is your mother? How&#8217;s the dog? You&#8217;re the only person I like kissing. Yes, I see people. I&#8217;ve seen people. You didn&#8217;t hurt me so much. Not that much. But I don&#8217;t give keys back. I leave strange works of art behind. Galleries would refuse the things I leave behind.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>There was a feathered table I topped with a round lamp shatter-painted to resemble a strange egg. He was going to install a light for me. To give it dimension.</p>

        <p>I didn&#8217;t even move into our house. Not as an act. He and his father collected my things from the first flat I ever lived in, and deposited them into this home of many rooms and clean, sterile spaces. I have always wanted more than I have the capacity for, and the lavender carpets of Wolseley Crescent were soft with status.</p>

        <p>The night before the move I cried, worried that I lacked the essential elements of a home. When I arrived at my new address he had placed soap at every sink, and toilet brushes in both the bathrooms. Hand towels hung on the rails. The bed was made, one corner folded back. What I lacked in furniture I made up for in laundry detergent. He had filled the empty space with facets of the living, and I loved him for it. He bought me a kettle and though he was back at work, the metal was warm to the <a href="#grey-lynn" data-opens="grey-lynn">touch.</a></p>

          <p>We didn&#8217;t meet. As he drove to the airport he checked Facebook on his phone. &ldquo;Come home,&rdquo; his girlfriend posted. &ldquo;Your dinner is getting cold and eaten.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>&ldquo;Soon my pretty!&rdquo; he replied, and in the same breath he sent me a message saying that he was sorry we never managed to get together.</p>

          <p>What claim could I have made to him to prove his lack of me? My break ups have resulted in unequal friendships. A kindness loosely masks a subtle competition: who made the mistake of letting the other go?</p>

          <p>When I see the men I have loved I feel more of a need to be beautiful, and owned, than successful. On paper, my life struggles to compete. I seek some dimension of myself beyond the known: some shimmering aspect that he wants to reach out and run his fingers through. Or, if he can&#8217;t see it, I want him to wonder what another man has seen in me.</p>

          <p>I know he&#8217;s in love with someone else. But to wonder. Just to wonder. I would like him to wonder at me. I used to ask him why he loved me, and he could never really answer. He is not the most eloquent man. He is kind. And he has the capacity to harness belief in things, in people. I would like him to believe in me <a href="#aria-2" data-opens="aria-2" data-closes="wolfie">again.</a></p>

        <p>On the last trip we picked and stewed apples. Green apples from the trees in the chook yards. It&#8217;s not something we did often, though it feels like a secure memory. I dislike stewed apple: my grandmother would make it to quell my mother&#8217;s nausea. But we picked apples and there are photographs of my body in the tree and roosters gathered at my feet.</p>

        <p>I insisted that we had a fire down by the swimming hole. That is a tangible memory: my grandfather grilling chops on a grate dug into the mountain. My after-swim body tucked warm into my mother&#8217;s, wrapped in a towel sketched with penguins. On the hill were tangled vines of blackberry, sprayed so that we couldn&#8217;t eat the fruit. The spraying only held them at bay, and eventually my cousins left the farm because one was allergic to the pathogens. I suspect that they wanted to seek their fortune elsewhere, in the same way I&#8217;ve blamed housecats and allergies (which are real) for houses that I&#8217;ve wanted to leave. I may be wrong, but I think symptoms can be managed while the trade-offs are worth it. I was willing to pay my current rent when I thought I might be a different, more bohemian sort of person here. I can no longer afford it.</p>

        <p>My grandmother said the sticks wouldn&#8217;t light: they looked dry, and it hadn&#8217;t rained, but they were damp inside. I wheeled the barrow down the long and twisting drive, with a torch in one hand and the barrow&#8217;s prong in the other. I was desperate. There had never been enough days down at the swimming hole, with my grandmother swimming in her bucket hat and my grandfather rowing a blow-up boat brimming with tiny us. There were dragonflies and toy boats that came ashore from nowhere. There were kingfishers and mythic eels and flames that flickered pastel through the sky. Thick sausages that burst with fat. My grandfather&#8217;s homemade bread, which no one can replicate. Wick sticks that snapped sap into the fire. Tiny rivers forged by thin bridges, which echoed with our gumboots, and a goat named Whiskey tied up on the hill.</p>

        <p>We lit the fire. I think it burned on will alone. My brother pierced sausages with sharpened twigs and turned them above the flame. I wrapped potatoes in foil and cooked them from raw to black. There were marshmallows, and a whole box of apples. My grandmother wore gardening gloves to handle her sausage, as if she was tending this last memory.</p>
